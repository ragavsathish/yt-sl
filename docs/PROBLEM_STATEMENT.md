# Problem Statement

Educational content creators, students, and researchers frequently watch lengthy YouTube videos containing presentation slides. Extracting these slides manually is time-consuming and inefficient—viewers must pause, take screenshots, and organize them.

Existing solutions often:
- Require manual effort and time
- Lack automated slide detection (extracting duplicate frames)
- Don't provide structured, accessible outputs
- May not extract text from slides via OCR
- Are not cross-platform or easily distributable

The goal is to build a command-line tool that automatically extracts unique slides from YouTube videos, performs OCR to retrieve text content, and exports everything to a Markdown document with embedded images for easy reference, editing, and sharing.
